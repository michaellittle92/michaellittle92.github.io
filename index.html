            <a href="FrontendMentor/QRCode/index.html">QR Code</a>
          </h4>
          <p>
            This QR component was a little more basic than my last couple of
            projects, so it felt like a good opportunity to write my first ever
            react component.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was definitely overkill for this project but turned out to be a
            good learning experience in setting up and structuring a react
            project, writing the component with jsx and building and deploying
            the project.
          </p>

          <p>
            It has highlighted some issues that i will need to solve around the
            efficiency of the project creation and build steps, as well as the
            general need to get better at react.

            <a href="FrontendMentor/Ratings /ratings.html">Ratings Component</a>
          </h4>
          <p>
            This is a working ratings component, the selected radio button's
            value gets passed through to the javscript and then removes and
            re-renders the elements inside the ratings component.
          </p>

          <p>
            I found this project a little frustrating on the js side. Creating
            each element after the form submission felt a bit verbose and kind
            of messy. I think this is the value of using a framework like react,
            and has encouraged me to begin learning a framework.

          This project featured a simple two-column layout that shifts to one
          column on mobile. While not the most technically challenging, breaking
          down elements into categories and applying past experience helped me
          complete it quickly. My main goal with these Frontend Mentor projects
          is to enhance my speed and efficiency in frontend implementation.

        <p>A responsive results summary component built with css grid</p>
        <p>
          This was a challenge to style and match a more data driven user
          experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have extended this project by pulling the data in from a series of
          random json files to simulate an API call, and I have created some
          themes that get assigned based on the users overall score. This score
          is calculated as the average of each of the category scores.

        <p>A responsive design built with html and vanilla CSS.</p>
        <p>
          This small project was very simple and felt like a good way to work on
          speed, especially with the css, as well as a good oppertunity to get
          used to css grid.

          This was a nice way to dip my toe back into front end development. It
          was very relaxing to bulid something without the pressure of a
          university grade hanging over my head.

          This small project was very simple and felt like a good way to work on
          speed, especially with the css. I think this also will be a good
          project to revisit to add infrastructure to, and make more dyanmic.

          An interacive Faq Accordion Element, build with css grid and vanilla
          js.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project was a bit challenging, as it involved several responsive
          elements that needed to be both adaptable and interactive. It was a
          valuable lesson in slowing down and ensuring each component was
          correctly implemented before moving forward. Looking at the final
          result, I see potential opportunities for improvement, particularly by
          incorporating animations to enhance the user experience.
