          This was a nice way to dip my toe back into front end development. It
          was very relaxing to bulid something without the pressure of a
          university grade hanging over my head.

          This small project was very simple and felt like a good way to work on
          speed, especially with the css. I think this also will be a good
          project to revisit to add infrastructure to, and make more dyanmic.
