        <p>A responsive results summary component built with css grid</p>
        <p>
          This was a challenge to style and match a more data driven user
          experience.

        <p>
          I have extended this project by pulling the data in from a series of
          random json files to simulate an API call, and I have created some
          themes that get assigned based on the users overall score. This score
          is calculated as the average of each of the category scores.

        <p>A responsive design built with html and vanilla CSS.</p>
        <p>
          This small project was very simple and felt like a good way to work on
          speed, especially with the css, as well as a good oppertunity to get
          used to css grid.

          This was a nice way to dip my toe back into front end development. It
          was very relaxing to bulid something without the pressure of a
          university grade hanging over my head.

          This small project was very simple and felt like a good way to work on
          speed, especially with the css. I think this also will be a good
          project to revisit to add infrastructure to, and make more dyanmic.

          An interacive Faq Accordion Element, build with css grid and vanilla
          js.

        <p>
          This project was a bit challenging, as it involved several responsive
          elements that needed to be both adaptable and interactive. It was a
          valuable lesson in slowing down and ensuring each component was
          correctly implemented before moving forward. Looking at the final
          result, I see potential opportunities for improvement, particularly by
          incorporating animations to enhance the user experience.
